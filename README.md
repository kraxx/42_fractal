# 42_fractal
Fractal generator. Wows and bedazzles. Built as part of 42 Coding University's graphics branch.
## Getting started
From the root directory, run:
```
make
```
To run the program, enter:
```
./fract_ol [fractal name]
```
Current list of fractals:
```
julia
mandelbrot
ship
menace
crevice
fish
time
ray
```
